# E-Commerce React Starter

This is a small starter e-commerce website built with React and Vite. It includes:

- Product listing and detail
- Shopping cart with persistence (localStorage)
- Simple checkout form (simulated)

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\LENOVO\OneDrive\Desktop\ecomerce"
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes and next steps
- This starter uses in-memory/static product data at `src/data/products.js`.
- To add a real backend, replace data access with API calls (e.g., using Axios).
- Consider adding authentication, payment integration, product filtering, and pagination.

Enjoy! If you want, I can add TypeScript, Tailwind, tests, or a simple Express backend next.
